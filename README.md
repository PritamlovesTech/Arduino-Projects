-NodeMCU Car- 
Here, I created an Arduino car with the help of a NodeMCU chip, which can be wirelessly controlled by any smart screen touch device.

-Security System-
Whenever this device detects motion in its range, then it makes an alert sound and at the same time, it also sends 'Alert messages' in the telegram app no matter if you are anywhere in the world, it's a great home security system.
